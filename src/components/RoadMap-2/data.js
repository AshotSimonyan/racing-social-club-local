          The trait utilities are introduced by RSC as a very unique way to provide utility. This way of providing utility will be very dynamic. We will announce some of the trait utilities before mint, but we also will announce some after mint. In the future we might even transfer the utility from one trait category to another oneâ€¦ We will change the game, people will be blown away by this new, innovative way of providing value to holders.
