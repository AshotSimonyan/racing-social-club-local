                  We created 10 Legendaries, which will be 1/1 racers with their own unique traits. The Legendaries are not only aesthetically perfect, they are also the most rare Racers of the collection, and perhaps have some extra benefits for you as a holder. Owning one of the legendary NFTâ€™s of Racing Social Club will be the ultimate goal.
