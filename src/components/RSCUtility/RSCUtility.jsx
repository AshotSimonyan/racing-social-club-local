          <p>
            We, at Racing Social Club, consider our community as top priority.
            We aim to provide as much value as we can, and therefore our utility
            contains multiple layers. The first form of utility we offer are the
            Membership Utilities, and the second form of utility we offer are
            the Trait-Based Utilities.

                  The trait utilities are introduced by RSC as a very unique way
                  to provide utility. This way of providing utility will be very
                  dynamic. We will announce some of the trait utilities before
                  mint, but we also will announce some after mint. In the future
                  we might even transfer the utility from one trait category to
                  another oneâ€¦ We will change the game, people will be blown away
                  by this new, innovative way of providing value to holders.
