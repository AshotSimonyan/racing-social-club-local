            <p>
              We, at Racing Social Club, consider our community as top priority.
              We aim to provide as much value as we can, therefore our utility
              contains multiple layers. We have divided the utility in two
              different forms. The first form of utility we offer, are
              Membership
              utilities, and the second form of utility we offer are Trait
              Utilities.

                    The trait utilities are introduced by RSC as a very unique
                    way
                    to provide utility. This way of providing utility will be
                    very
                    dynamic. We will announce some of the trait utilities before
                    mint, but we also will announce some after mint. In the
                    future
                    we might even transfer the utility from one trait category
                    to
                    another oneâ€¦ We will change the game, people will be blown
                    away by this new, innovative way of providing value to
                    holders.
