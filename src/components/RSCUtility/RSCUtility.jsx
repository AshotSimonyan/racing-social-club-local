              We, at Racing Social Club, consider our community as top priority.
              We aim to provide as much value as we can, therefore our utility
              contains multiple layers. We have divided the utilities in two
              different forms. The first form of utilities we offer, are
              Membership utilities, and the second form are Trait Utilities.

                      holders can race each other (and professional racing
                      drivers) in go-karts.

                    The trait utilities are introduced by RSC as a very unique
                    way to provide utility. This way of providing utility will
                    be very dynamic. We will announce some of the trait
                    utilities before mint, but we will also announce some after
                    mint. In the future we might even transfer the utility from
                    one trait category to anotherâ€¦ We will change the game,
                    people will be blown away by this new, innovative way of
                    providing value to holders.
