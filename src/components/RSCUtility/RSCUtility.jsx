          <p>
            We, at Racing Social Club, consider our community as top priority.
            We aim to provide as much value as we can, therefore our utility
            contains multiple layers. We have divided the utility in two
            different forms. The first form of utility we offer, are Membership
            utilities, and the second form of utility we offer are Trait
            Utilities.

                  The trait utilities are introduced by RSC as a very unique way
                  to provide utility. This way of providing utility will be very
                  dynamic. We will announce some of the trait utilities before
                  mint, but we also will announce some after mint. In the future
                  we might even transfer the utility from one trait category to
                  another oneâ€¦ We will change the game, people will be blown
                  away by this new, innovative way of providing value to
                  holders.
