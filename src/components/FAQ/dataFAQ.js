        question: "WHAT IS AN NFT?",
        answer: <>
            <p>An NFT is a Non-Fungible Token, which is a digital asset that is interchangeable through the
                internet and is stored on the blockchain. In simple terms this means that you can own a digital asset
                that
                is verified on the blockchain. The verifiable ownership of the NFT’s, makes it easier to see who the
                owner
                is. This gives the NFT value, as people like to show off their digital assets. In a world where the
                digital
                space is becoming such an important center point of life. NFT’s will become more popular over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interesting about NFT’s, is that there is an underlying smart contract that can be used in different
                ways. In simple terms, a smart contract is a digital contract, where actions are automatically activated
                based on an agreement between two parties. In the smart contract, there could be documented that the
                owner of a certain NFT has the right to receive something or the right to attend an event based on the
                ownership of the NFT. This means that owning an NFT of a certain project can automatically grant you
                access to the different utilities of the project.

        question: "HOW CAN I BUY a RSC NFT?",
        answer: <p>There are multiple ways to buy a RSC NFT. The first way is to be alert before the race starts. In our
            roadmap, we explained how you can qualify yourself for the mint. When we launch the collection, you will be
            able to mint for the price that is set before the launch. If you are not able to mint a piece, you can buy
            one on the secondary market (Opensea). The only option to buy our NFT’s is via our OFFICIAL site or on
            Opensea.</p>,
    },
    {
        question: "WHAT DOES “MINT” MEAN?",
        answer: <p>In simple terms, minting an NFT is the process of turning a digital file into a digital asset. When
            you mint an NFT, you ‘buy’ a collectible that is stored on the blockchain and will appear in your wallet.
            The NFT that you bought can be traded on the market and transferred from wallet to wallet.</p>,

        question: "HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO BUY ONE OF THE RACERS?",
        answer: <p>The mint price of our Racer NFT’s is yet to be determined. We will make sure that the price will
            reflect the value of the NFT. We added a lot of utilities to our collection. We want to make the NFT’s
            accessible for everyone, but we also do not want to lowball our value and future potential.</p>,

        question: "WHERE DID THE IDEA OF STARTING A RACING NFT COME FROM?",
        answer: <>
            <p>Racing is one of the most exiting sports in the world. Speed, danger, emotion, competition. A race has
                everything to entertain a big crowd. The team consists of real racing fans who decided to express their
                passion into an NFT collection. The innovative technology behind NFT’s fits perfectly in the ideas that
                the Racing Social Club brand has in store.</p>
            <p>As one of the first racing NFT’s, we have a head start to make use of the massive potential. Next to our
                amazing utilities, we will keep adding partnerships in order to grow as a brand. For the long term, we
                see RSC become a household name in the racing industry. We appreciate our early supporters the most.
                They will be the first to benefit from the amazing brand that is being built. </p>
